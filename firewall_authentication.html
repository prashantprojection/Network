                <hr>
                <p>A firewall can support various authentication methods. Authentication in basic definition means a
                    user is claiming to be who they say they are and are allowed access to the resources they are
                    authenticating for. This is just like when we log into our Microsoft Windows computer and let
                    Windows know our identity by specifying our username and then by specifying our password we are
                    proving our identity. Finally Windows gives us access only to the resources we are allowed access
                    to. </p>
                <p>Firewall authentication can be used by various features. Two of the most common are for SSL VPN and
                    web filtering.</p>
               <hr>
                <p>Below are some of the common methods of authentication supported by most firewalls;</p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2 id="builtin">Built in Database authentication</h2>
                <p>
                    With a built in database for authentication a firewall contains a built in authentication database.
                    A user can authenticate against this database for access. The database is usually configured with
                    multiple usernames and passwords. Using built in database authentication is easy to configure and
                    very effective, however this method is not scalable. If changes are required often such as users
                    join and leave often, the firewall database will need to be continuously updated.</p>
                    <hr>
               
                <h2 id="ldap">LDAP Authentication</h2>
                <p>
                    You can use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to query and authenticate against your
                    directory server. Commonly this would be Active Directory, although this can be any directory
                    service that supports LDAP such as Novell directory Open LDAP and others. This is a scalable method
                    because a directory service is typically always kept up to date. We do not need to update the local
                    firewall because it is querying the directory server.</p>
                    <hr>
                
                <h2 id="certificate">Certificate Authentication</h2>
                <p>
                    With most firewalls you can use a public signed certificate or a self signed certificate for
                    firewall authentication. If a firewall is public facing to anyone from the outside world it should
                    be setup with a publicly recognisable certificate to authenticate itself to anonymous users. A
                    publicly recognisable certificate is issued by someone like VeriSign, Go Daddy or Thawte and are
                    known to common browsers such as Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox and so automatically trusted.
                </p>
                <p>However if a firewall is authenticating itself to known clients which are in its control, it can
                    easily be configured with a self signed certificate. A self signed certificate is freely issued by
                    the vendor of the firewall and because you’re in control of the clients you can install the related
                    certificate on the client browsers. You need to do this because browsers do not know this
                    certificate by default as it is self signed. You can deploy certificates on many client systems at
                    once using Active Directory group policy or something similar. A common use case here is for SSL VPN
                    users. As SSL VPN is a secure browser based application you can use self signed certificates which
                    would prevent the error page stating “The security certificate presented by this website was not
                    issued by a trusted certificate authority”.</p>

                <h2 id="twofact">Two Factor Authentications</h2>
                <center><img style="width: 100%; opacity: 0.7;" src="images/Two-Factor-Authentication.jpg" alt="Two-factor authentication"></center>
                <p>Two factor authentications is referred to as requiring two different factors in order to authenticate
                    before you are allowed access. It is usually in form of something you know (password) and something
                    you have (software or hardware token). It can also optionally be something you are (finger print). A
                    very common method is to configure your firewall to require authentication using hardware token as
                    well as your personal password. In an SSL VPN scenario you would log in to the SSL portal with your
                    personal password as well as the 6 digit number displayed on your hardware token. Without a
                    combination of the two you will not be allowed access. This enables far better security than relying
                    on a single password. After all if someone did steal your password they have access to your
                    company’s corporate network. There are a number of two factor authentication vendors such as RSA,
                    CryptoCard and more which can be integrated with most firewalls.</p>

                <h2 id="singlesign">Single Sign In</h2>
                <p>Single sign on ensures a user is transparently authenticated to a firewall without them having to
                    manually log in. An example of a firewall integrated with Active Directory is when a user logs into
                    the network a firewall agent polls this information from Active Directory and forwards this
                    information to the firewall. So when a user challenges a policy that the firewall requires
                    authentication for, the firewall knows this user is already authenticated to the network. It then
                    decides weather the user is allowed access or not depending on who the user is. If the user is
                    allowed access, the firewall will let them access the required resources without the end user
                    noticing anything. So the user has authenticated without manually having to specify a password
                    again.</p>

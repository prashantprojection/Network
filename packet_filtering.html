                <p>Packet filtering firewall is a network security technique that is used to control data flow to and
                    from a network. It is a security mechanism that allows the movement of packets across the network
                    and controls their flow on the basis of a set of rules, protocols, IP addresses, and ports.
                </p>
                <p>Packet filtering protects a local network from undesired invasion depending upon the predefined
                    rules. The information passes through a network in the form of small pieces called packets, which
                    travel independently across IP networks. These small packets travel through a node only if they
                    match with predefined filtering rules otherwise get dropped. Hence, the filtering rules that are
                    defined by the network layer firewalls in a packet filtering firewall prove to be highly efficient
                    in providing security mechanisms.</p>
                   
               <hr>
                <h2 id="diagram">Packet Filtering Diagram</h2>
                <p>Packet filtering controls (allows or drops) packet or data transfer based on the following standards:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The address the packet is coming from.</li>
                    <li>The address the packet is going to.</li>
                    <li>The application protocols or rules set to transfer the data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The packets filtering firewall shows how filtration is executed on the firewall. The packet filtering
                    firewall checks access control lists (ACLs) to separate packets depending upon the upper-layer
                    protocol ID, source and destination port numbers, source and destination IP addresses, and packet
                    transmission route.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The packet filtering firewall analyses for the source and destination IP addresses, source, and
                        destination port numbers, and protocol IDs of IP packets as per an ACL. The firewall checks for
                        the information contained in the IP, TCP, or UDP header, and then it decides to accept or drop
                        the packet depending upon the ACL.</li>
                    <li>The firewall can allow the fragment type packets after comparing the information with the
                        ACL.</li>
                    <li>Additionally, it has a default method, set by users, that allows the packets to pass even if
                        these do not qualify with the ACL.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The passage of packets depends entirely on the decision of the packet filtering
                    router firewall. It filters the packets according to the security protocols programmed into the
                    router using the firewall rules. These packet filtering firewall rules are set up by users to build
                    protection against packets transmission and allow only packets that match certain IP addresses or
                    ports. Users may specify rules that will permit only those packets that are meant for their server
                    and decline all other packets. For example, rules may be set to completely reject packets heading
                    for the ports used by NetBIOS, which in turn prevents unwanted intrusion of Internet hackers on
                    NetBIOS server resources.</p>
                <p>A packet-filtering firewall can be distinguished into the following types based on the usage of
                    rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Static packet filtering firewall<: In this type of firewall rules are
                        established manually, and the connection between the internal and external networks left open or
                        closed at all times until changed manually.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic packet filtering firewall:< This type of firewall is a more intelligent
                        way of filtering as rules may be changed dynamically depending upon the conditions, and ports
                        are open only for a specific time otherwise remains closed.</li>
                    <li>Stateful packet filtering firewall:< It uses a presettable for maintaining a
                        secure connection, and packets pass through in a sequence as approved by the filter rules.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="advdis">Advantages and Disadvantages of Packet Filtering Firewall</h2>
                <p>Packet-filtering firewalls usually run on either general-purpose computers/routers or a
                    special-purpose router and have their share of packet filtering firewall advantages and
                    disadvantages.</p>
                <p>Packet filtering is an efficient defense system against intrusions from computers or networks outside
                    a local area network (LAN). It is also a standard and cost-effective means of protection as most
                    routing devices itself possess integrated filtering capabilities, so there is no need for setting a
                    new firewall device. Following are some of the prominent advantages of packet filtering firewall
                    that makes it highly acceptable worldwide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Need only one router:< The key advantage of using packet filtering is that it
                        requires the use of only one screening router to protect an entire network.</li>
                    <li>Highly efficient and fast: <The packet filtering router works very fast and
                        effectively and accepts and rejects the packets quickly based upon the destination and source
                        ports and addresses. However, other firewall techniques show more time-consuming performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>Transparent to users:< Packet filtering works independently without any need for
                        user knowledge or cooperation. Users wonâ€™t get to know about the transmission of packets until
                        there is something that got rejected. On the contrary, other firewalls require custom software,
                        the configuration of client machines, or specific training or procedures for users.</li>
                    <li>Built-in packet filtering in routers: <Packet filtering capacities are inbuilt
                        in widely used hardware and software routing products. Additionally, now most websites possess
                        packet filtering techniques available in their routers itself, which also makes this technique
                        the most inexpensive one.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although packet filtering offers several advantages, it also has some weaknesses. Some of the
                    disadvantages of a packet filtering firewall are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Filtration based on IP address or Port Information: <The biggest disadvantage of
                        packet filtering is that it works on the authentication of IP address and port number and not
                        based on the information like context or application.</li>
                    <li>Packet filtering is stateless:< Another big disadvantage of packet filtering is
                        that it does not remember any past invasions or filtered packets. It tests every packet in
                        isolation and is stateless which allows hackers to break the firewall easily.</li>
                    <li>No safety from address spoofing: <The packet filtering does not protect from IP
                        spoofing, in which hackers can insert fake IP addresses in packets to intrude the network.</li>
                    <li>Not a perfect option for all networks:< The packet filtering firewalls
                        implementation in highly desirable filters becomes difficult or highly time-consuming. Managing
                        and configuring ACLs sometimes get difficult.</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>
                <h2 id="example">Packet Filtering Firewall Example</h2>
                <p>Packet filters act on the source and destination IP and port addresses that are present in each
                    TCP/IP packet. You can set rules allowing access to only familiar and established IP addresses and
                    denying access to all unknown or unrecognized IP addresses.</p>
                <p>For example, if you set rules denying access to port 80 to outsiders, you would block off all outside
                    access to the HTTP server as most HTTP servers run on port 80. Alternatively, you can set packet
                    filtering firewall rules permitting packets designated for your mail or web server and rejecting all
                    other packets.</p>
                <p>Despite its weaknesses, packet filter firewalls are widely used for being leverage and inexpensive.
                    It controls the movement of information/packets according to a set of rules defined by the user and
                    protects the network from unwanted intrusion or attacks. Thus, it acts as a powerful security tool
                    and provides a good level of security to the network.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and
                    decides whether
                    to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.</p>
                <p>Firewalls have been a first line of defense in network security for over 25 years. They establish a
                    barrier
                    between secured and controlled internal networks that can be trusted and untrusted outside networks,
                    such as the
                    Internet.</p>
                <p>A firewall can be hardware, software, or both.</p>

                    <h3 id="proxyfw">Proxy Firewall</h3>
                    <p>An early type of firewall device, a proxy firewall serves as the gateway from one network to
                        another for a
                        specific application. Proxy servers can provide additional functionality such as content caching
                        and
                        security by preventing direct connections from outside the network. However, this also may
                        impact throughput
                        capabilities and the applications they can support.</p>

                    <p>This is about the most basic type and this Firewall application is for creating a barrier at the
                        router. The working of the Firewall is only for checking the source and destination IPs without
                        going into packet details. This is a Firewall example of one of the oldest architectures.</p>

                    <h3 id="statfw">Stateful inspection Firewall</h3>
                    <p>Now thought of as a “traditional” firewall, a stateful inspection firewall allows or blocks
                        traffic based on
                        state, port, and protocol. It monitors all activity from the opening of a connection until it is
                        closed.
                        Filtering decisions are made based on both administrator-defined rules as well as context, which
                        refers to
                        using information from previous connections and packets belonging to the same connection.</p>

                    <p>A software Firewall definition is that it is a software installed on a device without any
                        additional hardware. This answers the question of what is a Firewall software as well. Is
                        Windows Firewall enough might be a legitimate doubt regarding stand-alone or individual
                        computers? While windows give some basic protection, the need for firewalls in the form of an
                        anti-virus plus application is always there.</p>

                        before they arrive at the servers. The major disadvantages of Firewalls of the hardware type are
                        that they are easy for insider attacks to bypass them and the hardware capabilities vary with
                        each supplier.</p>

                        <p>Firewalls have evolved beyond simple packet filtering and stateful inspection. Most companies
                            are

                            application-layer attacks.</p>
                        <p>According to Gartner, Inc.’s definition, a next-generation firewall must include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Standard firewall capabilities like stateful inspection</li>

                            <li>Application awareness and control to see and block risky apps</li>
                            <li>Upgrade paths to include future information feeds</li>
                            <li>Techniques to address evolving security threats</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While these capabilities are increasingly becoming the standard for most companies, NGFWs can
